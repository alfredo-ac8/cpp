### Education and academic experience

### Entrepreneurial experience

In 2009 with my brother Andrea Giovannelli, Patricia Barcala Dominguez and two additional friends we started dreaming about a company to work with advanced nanotechnological materials. The next year we submitted a business plan to the [eCapital business plan competition](www.ecapital.it), winning in early 2011 the first prize. In July 2011 we founded the startup **Nano-Tech**, working on nanostructured epoxy resins. Today, Nano-Tech Spa, is a fast growing specialty chemical company producing nanostructured advanced composite materials with applications in the automotive, aerospace, marine and sport-goods sectors. The company has several patents and disruptive technologies like the _3Dynamics®_  nanoparticle dispersion technology and the _C-preg®_  high-temperature prepregs. As co-founder and shareholder, I served in the company for several year in different roles, including R&D Advisor and Member of the Board of Directors. [www.italnanotech.com](www.italnanotech.com)

In 2016, with the backing of some of Nano-Tech investors and with a team of awesome people I founded a new biotech start-up, **Cypress Biotechnology**, working to develop innovative biotechnological solutions in the field of antimicrobial materials and novel bioactive compounds through innovative pipelines and cross-disciplinary approaches. The company is still in it early stages but I am sure it will take off. [www.cypressbiotechnology.com](www.cypressbiotechnology.com)

Following my experience with two startup and after a number of year in the overgrowing ecosystem of Italian startup, incubators and accelerators and having successfully raised funding for Nano-Tech through multiple rounds I decided to put some of my experience to good use supporting early stage startups in the growth of their business. In 2017 I assembled a team of professionals with experience in different aspects of early stage business and created **The Foundry**. The Foundry is an early stage start-up investment group that provides advising, counseling and support services through work-for-equity type of approach. The group has several active start-up projects. [www.thefoundry.it](www.thefoundry.it)

Following my passion for the land and for the product it can give, and fascinated by the production of wine in 2018 I started collaborating with one of the most famous winemaker of the Marche region, **Alberto Serenelli**. Alberto is a three generation winemaker located in the Conero area, near Ancona, Italy. For the past 30 years, the red and white wines produced by the vineyard have excelled among the products of the region, collecting countless awards from Italian and international sommelier and wine associations. The small scale production (~20,000 bottle/year) is characterized by a constant search for perfection and emotions, with a small range of premium wines produced only in selected vintages.
